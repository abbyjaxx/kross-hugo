I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Carleton College. I have taken 1 intro to CS class, 
and did so well that Bill Gates calls me every other week trying to hire me. My favorite
color is generally dark red or a light teal, but can vary depending on the time of day.

Please feel free to stop by my house, email, or call me at any hour of the day or night.
I am in desperate need of stranger companionship and would really like it if any of y'all
could reach out. Call me. Please.

Anyhow, I am interested in immunology and cancer research so please actually do call or
reach out if you are interested in working with a quarantined almost-graduate.
